                    <p>Stress, anxiety, and physical inactivity are quietly becoming public health threats. From packed schedules and constant screen time to sedentary work habits, many people are struggling to care for their mental and physical well-being. EaseUp was created to offer a simple, sustainable way to counter this, helping people feel better through short, accessible practices that fit into daily life.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The facts:</h3>
                    <ul class="about-facts">
                        <li><strong>1 in 4 U.S. adults</strong> reports getting no physical activity outside of work. This sedentary lifestyle is directly linked to chronic pain, cardiovascular disease, and even early death.
                            <br><em>(Source: America's Health Rankings)</em>
                        </li>
                        <li>Physical inactivity is projected to cause <strong>500 million new cases of preventable disease</strong> by 2030, costing the world <strong>$27 billion every year</strong>.
                            <br><em>(Source: The Lancet Global Health, 2022)</em>
                        </li>
                        <li>More than <strong>1 in 3 U.S. adults</strong> reports symptoms of anxiety or depression, yet the majority do not receive professional care.
                            <br><em>(Source: CDC, 2023)</em>
                        </li>
                        <li>Just 10 minutes of daily movement can reduce poor mental health days by over 40%.
                            <br><em>(Source: UCLA Health)</em>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Despite these numbers, most wellness apps feel like another chore. They demand your time, attention, or data.</p>
                    
                    <p>EaseUp delivers a refreshingly intuitive solution. Quick, meaningful well-being support that fits into real life.</p>
